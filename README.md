🛹 Skateboard City – Responsive Website

Skateboard Cityis a responsive website that celebrates the history, culture, and lifestyle of skateboarding. It explores the evolution of skateboards, iconic brands, and the influence of skateboarding on fashion and youth identity.

📖 About the Project

Skateboarding began as a surf-inspired street sport in the early 1960s. The first self-produced boards were sold by Val-Surf in 1962, featuring roller skate trucks and a surfboard-like shape. Soon after, Peterson Forbes introduced the first industrially manufactured skateboards with improved trucks.

As skateboarding gained popularity, it influenced the clothing industry, leading to the rise of streetwear brands like Vans, Etnies, Converse, and DC Shoe— all of which created footwear tailored for skateboarding performance and style.

This website documents that journey and invites users to explore the roots and impact of skateboarding.
